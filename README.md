# SVG Logo Maker

  ## Description
This is a simple Command Line Interface that takes user input and generates a simple svg file. The user can select either a square, triangle, or circle for their background shape, along with up to 3 characters to display inside. For colors, the user can simply submit any of the common keywords, but they can also enter specific hexadecimals as well.

This project is my first dive into test driven development. Jest was used in order to test and confirm that svg shapes were being rendered as expected.
